# NFL Prop Bets Mini App (Clean Branch)

This branch is cleaned for **Vercel deploys** â€” no Hardhat/solidity deps in root.  
Use this for hosting the Next.js app.

## Contracts
Smart contracts are in `/contracts` with their own `package.json` and TypeScript (5.0.x) toolchain.

## Running locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
